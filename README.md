# Disease Prediction Application Using 3 Machine Learning Algorithms! 

In this project I've created a python application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) (which needs lots of improvement...) using tkinter. 

The application calculates with an accurate percentage (which is shown on the terminal and not on the GUI) the disease that a patient might have, based on the symptoms that he/she provides! 

It uses 3 Machine Learning Algorithms so we can see the percentage possibility result of each of these and get a more accurate total result of the disease. 
**The algorithms that are used are the following:** 

* [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
* [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
* [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) 

## Installation Instructions: 
##### (On linux machines)

*After cloning the code or downloading the zip file into your machine you'll first have to install some dependencies: 

1. **sklearn** *sudo apt-get install python3-sklearn* 
2. **pandas** *sudo apt-get install python3-pandas* 
3. **numpy** *sudo apt-get install python3-numpy* 
4. **tkinter** *sudo apt-get install python3-tk* 

**The above command is for ubuntu linux distros and presupposes that you have python3 installed on your system.** *Adjust accordingly for different distros, versions* 

## Running the application: 

On the terminal inside the directory of the project type: **python3 clean_code.py** The Graphical Interface of the application will start and the use of it, is straightforward. (Remember if u want to see the predictive percentage of each algorithm take a look on your terminal after pressing each of the algorithm buttons.)
